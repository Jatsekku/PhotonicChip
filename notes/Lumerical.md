https://man.e-science.pl/pl/kdm/oprogramowanie/ansys2

It's possible to get Lumerical License and instalation files from WCSS. \
Installer files on nextcloud server: https://nextcloud.e-science.pl/index.php/apps/files/files/35020885?dir=/kdm-software/ansys/lumerical

License server: 
```
ansys.licencja.icm.edu.pl
```

It required to connect via KDM VPN to access license server! \
Infomration how to setup GlobalConnect and connect to the VPN can be found here:

## Lumerical FTDT Introduction
https://innovationspace.ansys.com/product/lumerical-fdtd-my-first-simulation/

## Overview/takeaways

### Lesson #1
- Why FTDT is used in photonic simulation?
- Basic wokflow of Lumerical simulation.
- Iteraative nature of prototyping process.
- Covergance testing.

### Lesson #2 - Simulation setup
- Setting up materials parameters (Material Databse).
- Complex geometries can be imported as CAD/STL files.
- Simulation geometry, simulation time, mesh settings, boundry conditions.
- Mesh override for local mesh with changed resolution (ie. denser around smaller structures).
- Sources for injecting light.
- Monitors for collecting simultion data.
- Demo show the full workflow of simulating thin-film nanocrystals.

### Lesson #3 - Running the simulation
- Material explorer - lets check curve fitted to material data.
- Memory report - lets check required RAM/disk space for running the simulation

### Lesson #4
