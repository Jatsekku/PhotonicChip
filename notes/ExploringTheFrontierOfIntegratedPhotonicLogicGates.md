# Exploring the Frontier of Integrated Photonic Logic Gates: Breakthrough Designs and Promising Applications

## Overview
- Paper has the review form of breakthrogh in photonic logic gate design and novel materials.
- Abstract is pretty standard (why photonic ICs matters and how can be used).
- Chapter 2 is basically truth tables for abstract logic gates.
- Chapter 3 brings lots of studies on structures and materials used in photonic logic gates.
Especially interesting is Table 3 which sums up key characteristic for different technologies.
- Chapter 4 describe some chalenges in relation to real-world applications. Rather basic information.
Comparasion with electronic LGs in Table 4 gives some rough overview though.
